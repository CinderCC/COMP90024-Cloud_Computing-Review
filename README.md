+ 2016,2017 exam paper without answers

## The advice from original author
+ Prof. Richard can only talk about the superfical theories of the cloud computing techniques, seems like he cannot use or show any of the techniques. Anyway, "talk is cheap."
+ The Professor can only use plenty of ppt pages with boring texts and just read. The useful technical staff are all lectured by his PhD students or other lecturers.  
+ The assignment mark is very informal and the marking standard is very vague and not consistent between groups.  
+ The final exam questions are all about explaining the definations which are as useless as the lectures.
